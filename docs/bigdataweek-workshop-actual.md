# Introduction
As part of Big Data Week 2016 the Open Data Team at Landgate are beginning a series of workshops designed to educate, promote, and accelerate open government data sharing in Western Australia.

Help the WA community do more with the data government generates every day, and start the journey of sharing your data and knowledge with the WA community in a new way through data.wa.gov.au.

# Workshop Outline
Throughout this workshop we'll be utilising material from the UK's [Open Data Institute](http://theodi.org/), the world's leading independent, non-profit open data training and development organisation.

## Publishing your data on data.wa.gov.au
*15 minutes*

In this module we'll get our hands dirty and publish a new dataset to data.wa.gov.au.

If you've brought data of your own to publish, go ahead and follow the prompts in [Preparing the data](Preparing the data) and [Publishing the data](Publishing the data).

If you'd instead like to work with our example dataset, then we'll be using the State Library's [Western Australia Public Library Network](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datawagovau/toolkit/master/docs/workshops/example-data/libraries20150603.csv) dataset.

### Preparing the data
Before you publish a dataset there are a few key things to think about to ensure you're safely publishing a high quality, machine-readable, and useful dataset in a way that people will confidently be able to re-use it. 

In working through this checklist you may find it handy to refer to our quick visual [Checklist for identifying and preparing data for release](http://data.wa.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/9564/1179-Open-Data-flowchart-visual-A3.pdf) (PDF).

#### Checklist
1. Is the data in an open format?
2. Is the data clean?
3. Is the data safe to release?
4. Is the data openly licensed?
5. Is the data well described?
6. Is publishing the data sustainable?

### Publishing the data
1. Login to [data.wa.gov.au](http://catalogue.beta.data.wa.gov.au/user/login) using the credentials provided for the workshop.
2. Step through our [Publishing Data on Data.wa.gov.au Guide](http://toolkit.data.wa.gov.au/#publishing-data).
  - Fill out all of the relevant fields on the *Create dataset* screen.
  - *Upload* your data on the *Add data* screen and click **Save & add another**.
  - Add a *link* to the State Library's [Guide to Public Libraries](http://slwa.wa.gov.au/find/guide_to_public_libraries).
  - Click **Finish**.
3. Publish!

**Congratulations, you've just published your first dataset!**

## Questions and open discussion
*10 minutes*

We've kept some time free at the end to allow time for questions and open discussion around any topics the group might like to talk about in more detail. 

## Bonus Section: How could our example dataset be improved?
If time allows we'll run through a short thought exercise focussing on how we could improve our example dataset.

## Our Next Workshop
We're looking to run workshops like these approximately once a month, or as there is demand. There are 10 other modules in the course, and several areas where we're looking to add new modules (e.g. An in-depth workshop on cleaning data, How to work out what data people want, et cetera).

If you would like to take part in a future workshop, or have ideas for a new module, please let your presenters know or contact the [Open Data Team](mailto:opendata@landgate.wa.gov.au?Subject=Open%20Data%20Workshop%20Series).
