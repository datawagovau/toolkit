#Preparing data for release
##How should I approach licensing and charging?
Agencies will need to license their data appropriately, with clear terms surrounding copyright and use. Where possible and appropriate, a non-restrictive licence should be used to promote maximum dissemination and reuse of the data.

* __Existing licensing arrangements –__ where this makes the data available according to the
principles of the Policy.

* __Standardised licensing frameworks, such as *Creative Commons* –__ where existing licensing
arrangements are not suitable, or there is no existing licence in place.

* __Other approaches to licensing –__ there may be instances where agencies are required to set out
special copyright arrangements; legislation stipulates a particular copyright position; or a more
restrictive licence to those provided under Creative Commons is required.

* __Intellectual property –__ data may have inherent intellectual property and deliver more value
and better outcomes for the State when access to the data is managed appropriately. Agencies
should consider the Western Australian Government Intellectual Property Policy 2015.

Wherever possible, agencies should make data available at no cost to users in order to maximise the
potential for reuse. However, there may be legitimate instances where agencies consider applying a
reasonable charge for the data. Agencies are encourage to discuss with the lead agency for
implementation (Landgate).

## How should I format the data to make it usable?
Data should be published in internationally recognised, open standard formats that make it easy to use and transform.
* __*Non-proprietary* and *machine-readable*__ formats are ideal.
* __Data as collected at the source, with a high level of *granularity*__ is preferred, however some
data may be best published in aggregate or modified forms, for example where there are
privacy considerations.

## How do I make the data easy to understand?
Data should be published with:
* __metadata__ to better enable users to understand the data and how best to use it; and

* __a statement regarding the data’s purpose and *quality*__, including sufficient information about
any caveats or limitations with regard to the dataset. This will better enable users to decide
whether a dataset is suitable for their purposes. 

__Resources:__
* the [ABS Data Quality Statement Tool](https://www.nss.gov.au/dataquality/index.jsp) which helps with assessing and reporting on the quality of
data; and
* the [Australian Government Open Data Toolkit – How to use data.gov.au – Metadata](https://toolkit.data.gov.au/index.php?title=How_to_use_data.gov.au#Metadata)

## How often (i.e. frequency) should I publish data?
Data should be as up-to-date as possible and made available to users in a timely manner. As data is
updated, agencies should aim to make it available as soon possible, or on a consistent, periodic basis.
