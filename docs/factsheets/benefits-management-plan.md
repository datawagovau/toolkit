# Benefits management plan

This fact sheet provides guidance on the benefits management plan used to monitor and evaluate the impact of the WA Whole of Government Open Data Policy.

## The link between benefits and action

The policy aims to support research and education, promote innovation and bolster productivity. It will also stimulate greater sharing and access to information across government to support evidence-based decision making in the public sector. The policy aims to increase the openness and transparency of government and its processes.

In order to assess the effectiveness of the policy and if these benefits are being achieved, a benefits management plan has been developed. The purpose of the plan is to monitor progress and provide a source of data for later evaluation.

The intent is to clearly link the actions that will be carried out in implementing the policy to data that indicates whether benefits are being achieved.

* Benefits
  * Benefits of open data
* Action
  * What will be done to realise these benefits?
* Measures
  * How will we know success is being achieved?

### What benefits to measure?

Broadly the benefits of the Policy cover three areas:

* improving the effectiveness and efficiency of services
* facilitating innovation outside of government to help solve community problems
* providing a more open, transparent and accountable government.
Measuring the variety of benefits from open data (including how it is used and the impact on the economy) is challenging, particularly in the short term. In order to minimise onerous data collection, some proxy measures are used. However this would not replace the need for larger surveys and case studies pertaining to the impact of the policy in the future.

The benefits, actions and measures are outlined in the table below, followed by detail on each measure including source, frequency of data, and whether baseline data has been collected.

###Reporting

It is expected that the measures and data will be published on data.wa.gov.au as metrics are updated. Some of the data will be passively collected (such as page views or review work by the Office of the Auditor General) while survey of users and agency data suppliers will be conducted on a six monthly basis for some data.

It is anticipated that the data collected will be staggered so not to overwhelm agencies and form a continuous evaluative work program.

##Benefits and Outcomes

###Improve the efficiency and effectiveness of services

Actions and measures:
* Increase use by government agencies of data to improve effectiveness and/or efficiency
  *Case studies from agencies publishing to data.wa.gov.au on cost/time savings of not needing a separate platform
  *Tally and rank metadata from publishers able to add estimated net cost or costs savings (time, money) into the metadata attached to their datasets when publishing
  *Case studies from agencies using government data and impact
  *Increase in the number of agencies using open government data
  *Number of Government agencies accessing data based on Government IP addresses
  
###Facilitate innovation outside of government to help solve community problems

Actions and measures:
*Make data discoverable to the public
  *Number of data requests made by users via data.wa.gov.au feedback mechanism
  *Y/N â€“ data.wa.gov.au contains datasets released through Freedom of Information (FOI) (excluding personal information related FOI)
  *Percentage of agency datasets that meet top level metadata standards (working URLs, file format matches preferred formats, machine-readable)
*Prevent inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information
  *Agencies have privacy review processes required prior to releasing data
*Assign roles and responsibilities to strengthen culture of data management
  *Y/N there is a single position assigned final responsibility for data management and release for each agency that is part of data.wa.gov.au
  *Percentage of agencies that publicly assign points of contact for open data issues
  *Government agencies views on their data awareness and open data processes
