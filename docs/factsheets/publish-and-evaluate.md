# Publishing data and evaluation
The next step is to publish the data and make it publically available. Data should be accessible through the
Government of Western Australia online data portal (data.wa.gov.au) – that is, published on the portal where
possible or, alternatively, on the agency’s website with a link from the portal.

Agencies should also assess their progress towards *open data maturity* and monitor the benefits and outcomes
of implementing the open data policy.

The lead agency for implementation (Landgate) will provide further information and assistance to agencies.
