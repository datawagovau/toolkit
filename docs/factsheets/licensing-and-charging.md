# Licensing and charging considerations for open government data
This fact sheet provides guidance to agencies on licensing data in a manner consistent
with the WA Whole of Government Open Data Policy (the policy) and should be
considered in conjunction with the [WA Government Intellectual Property Policy and Best
Practice Guidelines.](http://www.commerce.wa.gov.au/publications/intellectual-property-wa-government-intellectual-property-policy-and-best-practice)

## Licensing open government data
Open data should be licensed appropriately by agencies with clear terms surrounding
copyright and use. Where possible and appropriate, a non-restrictive licence should be
used to promote the maximum dissemination and reuse of the data.

Agencies are encouraged to use existing licensing arrangements applied to their data
where this makes the data available according to the principles of the policy. Where
these are not suitable, or there is no existing licence in place, the policy encourages the
use of standardised licensing frameworks, such as Creative Commons which provides
several standardised licenses that permit others to legally use and share your work.

The Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) licence, for example, is consistent with the
principles of the policy and allows others to share and adapt works (including for
commercial purposes) as long as the creator is attributed in accordance with the
licence. However it should be noted that once a Creative Commons licence has been
implemented, it cannot be revoked in favour of a more restrictive licensing regime. More
detailed information on Creative Commons is outlined below.

## Use of creative commons licensing
The Creative Commons licenses are designed to provide copyright owners with an
efficient way to manage the rights contained in their copyright work, and to provide data
users with simple and flexible terms for use. Creative Commons is an internationally
recognised licensing standard and has been adopted as the default position for open
data in many other jurisdictions.

### What Creative Commons licenses are available?
Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY), the recommended default license, allows users
to distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon the data, even commercially, as long as they
credit the licensor for the original creation in the terms required by the licensor. CC BY
is one of a number of licences in the Creative Commons licensing suite.

The following table outlines the Creative Commons licenses as described by Creative
Commons Australia:
