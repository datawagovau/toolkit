# Open data: where’s the benefit?
This fact sheet provides information about the value and benefits of open data, to
inform agencies implementing the WA Whole of Government Open Data Policy.

Government agencies collect and manage a vast array of data. It covers almost all
aspects of life in Western Australia including the economy, performance of police,
hospitals and schools, climate, location of Government services and facilities, land
zoning and use, native flora and fauna and local history.

## Who benefits from opening up Government data?
Opening up public sector data benefits both the Government and the community. The
initial investment in adopting new platforms and processes has considerable value for
the public sector, assisting knowledge-sharing between agencies and reducing
duplication of work.

However, it also benefits the State’s businesses, individuals, and not-for-profit
organisations, cutting through red tape and creating opportunities for new businesses
and services.

## What are the benefits?
Current estimates of the potential value of open government data in Australia range
into the tens of billions of dollars per annum. For example, in 2013, it was estimated
that the transport and education sectors alone could see over $30 billion in increased
economic value each year as a consequence of open data, with a further $30 billion
increase across the consumer products, energy, health, and finance sectors.

But where does this value come from? Much of it has to do with improving the way
Government services are designed and delivered, and in general, having the data and
tools to make better decisions. The examples in this fact sheet illustrate just a few of
the potential applications of open public sector data.

## Case studies
__Transport for NSW: reducing the cost of delivering Government services__
The New South Wales Government has equipped Sydney buses, trains, and ferries
with GPS technology that provide an open, real-time data stream. To promote the
release and increase public engagement, Transport for NSW ran a competition to
develop an app that used the stream. To-date, developers have created a range of
mobile apps that inform users about the availability and timeliness of transport services.
These community-driven services were developed at minimal cost to the Government,
greatly improve customer service, and are able to rapidly change and develop in
response to consumer needs.

__The UK Open Source Innovation Lab and GovHack Perth: new and creative uses of data__
The UK’s Open Source Innovation Lab used the Ordinance Survey (the UK’s national
mapping authority) open data to build a detailed map of Great Britain in the worldbuilding
game, Minecraft. The map is freely available to the game’s 33 million users –
many of whom are primary and secondary students – and can be used in schools as a
teaching tool. With easy access to open data, the developers were able to create the
map in only two weeks.

In the same way, participants at last year’s GovHack Perth event delivered innovative,
working projects in a very short timeframe. In just two days, open Government data
allowed teams to map, model and analyse Perth’s crime and traffic, create educational
games and tools and even invent a new approach to combining and sharing datasets
across different agencies.

__theyvoteforyou.org: a not-for-profit uses Parliamentary data to drive transparency__
The website theyvoteforyou.org, built by the OpenAustralia Foundation, uses open data
from Federal Parliament to give Australians real-time information about how their
Members of Parliament vote on various issues. Citizens can search by their postcode
or a MP’s name and see how the MP voted on each issue before Parliament. More
informatively, it also bundles similar issues to let users assess an MP’s general stance,
reports their attendance, and shows how often (and on what issues) an MP votes
against their party’s policy.

__Sense-T: cross-sector collaboration, innovation, and better decision-making__
The Sense-T resource management initiative in Tasmania brings together government,
the University of Tasmania, CSIRO, and IBM to develop tools for the agriculture sector.
Together, they have established a state-wide sensor network that collects real-time
information data on crops, livestock, water, weather, and even farm equipment. This
information allows consumers, farmers, and Government to make more informed
choices about food, water management, and resource planning. Along with forecasts, the real-time information will be released with an API (Application Programming Interface) that allows entrepreneurs to develop tools and apps using
Sense-T’s platform.

__Public sector efficiency: making it easier for public servants to do their jobs well__
Every day, Western Australian Government employees spend time transcribing data
from PDF documents, recalculating and reformatting information, and trying to track
down the right people in another agency to make a data request. Often basic data is
hard to find, or in the wrong format. Opening up this data, making it easier to find, and
releasing it in an accessible format allows for better decision-making, smarter (and
easier) analysis, and more efficient service delivery. Even better, publishing data with a
common structure makes it quick and easy to link and compare data from a variety of
agencies, and combine it to draw more informed conclusions (and so, make better
decisions).
