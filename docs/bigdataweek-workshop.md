# Introduction
As part of Big Data Week 2016 the Open Data Team at Landgate are beginning a series of workshops designed to educate, promote, and accelerate open government data sharing in Western Australia.

Help the WA community do more with the data government generates every day, and start the journey of sharing your data and knowledge with the WA community in a new way through data.wa.gov.au.

## Big Data Week 2016
[Big Data Week 2016](http://bdwperth.com/) is a great opportunity to celebrate progress with Western Australia's Open Data Policy, and help more people share their open government data with the broader community.

Nearly 1,000 datasets from some 40 WA public sector agencies are now shared with the WA community through data.wa.gov.au. The Open Data Team have received requests from the community for much more – from land development applications, to shark attacks, and popular baby names. 

That’s where you come in.

# Preparing for the workshop
**While parts of this workshop are broadly relevant to a general audience this workshop is primarily intended for public servants who will be publishers of government data.**

## Pre-reading
Before attending the workshop we suggest you familiarise yourself with Western Australia's Open Data Policy and its supporting material. Further information, and links to all of these documents are available at [data.wa.gov.au](http://data.wa.gov.au).

## What To Bring
We'll supply notepads, pens, good coffee, morning tea, and a friendly atmosphere.

### BYOD (Bring Your Own Device)
While we will work through the workshop live on the big screen for the benefit of all attendees this has been designed to be a hands-on workshop,so you'll get the most out of it if you bring your own device. Both tablets and laptops would be suitable.

WiFi will be available for attendees. 

### BYOD (Bring Your Own Data)
Got some data you would like to publish, but not sure about the best approach? We'll have some time to sit down and talk through it with you, so bring it along on the day.
